# Diabetes Linear Regression
This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict disease progression based on the diabetes dataset. The project is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library.  
## Project Structure

### 1. Loads the diabetes dataset.
### 2.Inspects the structure of the dataset.
### 3.Splits the dataset into training and test sets.
### 4.Trains a Linear Regression model.
### 5.Makes predictions on the test set.
### 6.Evaluates the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Explanation of Tasks
### 1.Load the Dataset:  
The diabetes dataset is loaded using load_diabetes from scikit-learn.
### 2.Inspect the Structure:  
The feature matrix and target variable are extracted and their structure is inspected.
### 3.Split the Dataset:  
The dataset is split into training and test sets using train_test_split.
### 4.Train the Model:
A Linear Regression model is trained using the training data.
### 5.Make Predictions:  
Predictions are made on the test set and compared to the actual values using a scatter plot.
### 6.Evaluate the Model:  
The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
